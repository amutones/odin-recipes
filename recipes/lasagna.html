    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Prep Work</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions</strong> add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to <em>clean</em> the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce</strong>. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375°</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles</strong>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 ½ cups of meat sauce</strong>.</li>
        <li>Top with<strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce</strong> .</li>
        <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture</strong>, and <strong>the rest of the meat sauce</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes</strong>. <em>Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</strong> to allow the layers to set. Serve with <strong>garlic bread with cheese</strong>.</li>
